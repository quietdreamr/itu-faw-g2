		"description": "Classic sparkling wine from Franschhoek made in the same time-consuming way as in Champagne. 75% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Noir. Harvested overnight and chilled until the next morning to preserve the freshness of the grape. The grapes are lightly pressed and the juice fermented for 14 days before being aged for 12 months in steel tanks. Once stabilised, the wine is aged a further 27 months in bottle, where it develops its fine bubble structure.\nThe Chardonnay grape gives the wine elegance and fruitiness, while the Pinot Noir adds complexity and length to the flavour. Notes of breadcrumbs, citrus and fresh red apples. Incredibly fine bubbles with an almost mousse-like texture. Really delicious wine.",

Harvested over a whopping 7 times at different ripening times to give as complex a wine as possible. So good fatness but still structure and a nice balanced barrel flavour - lovely. Aromas of lime, vanilla and flowers with a light mineral flavour.",

		"description": "One of the best Semillion wines on the market, period. Grapes come from Basil Landau's field in Franschhoek which is one of the oldest vineyards in all of South Africa, planted in 1905. The wine is made with the utmost respect for these grapes. Harvested in the evening and kept in the fridge until the next day. Unusual for white wine, but in order to obtain a powerful wine, maceration/first fermentation is allowed for 24 hours with the skins before pressing. Same technique used for Orange wine. The wine then ferments naturally for 6 weeks in oak barrels before fermentation is stopped and the wine matures for 12 months in 500L oak barrels.\r\nWe give the floor to Master of Wine, Greg Sherwood \"Super concentrated and broad, yet deeply sensual and textural, the wine finishes with clean white citrus, blackcurrant leaf and yellow tropical fruit candy notes. A joy to taste in a wine that really does full justice to these century-old vines from this famous vineyard in Franschhoek.\"",
